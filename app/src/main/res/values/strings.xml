    <string name="notification">The Android notifications menu sometimes fills up so fast, its easy to clear it without properly checking it. If youve done this, and think you might have accidentally swiped something important into non-existence, you can still get it back. Stock Android users can recover lost notifications on their Android device by finding the Android notification history. For devices with a different UI (such as Samsungs TouchWiz), this approach might not be available, but there is an app-based solution.
